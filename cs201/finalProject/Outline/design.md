#####1. Describe the user interface. What are the menu options and how will the user use the application?

The user interface will have 8 options initially

#####2. Describe the programmers' tasks:
- Describe how you will read the input file.
- Describe how you will process the data from the input file.
- Describe how you will store the data (what objects will you store?)
- How will you add/delete/modify data?
- How will you search the data?
- List the classes you will need to implement your application.

#####3. Draw a UML diagram that shows all classes in the program and their relationships. This can be done however you want. If you want a specific application, [StarUML](http://staruml.io/download) and [Draw.io](https://draw.io) are both good. But you are welcome to use any graphics program or just draw them by hand and scan them.

#####4. Think how you will determine if your code functions are expected. Develop a test plan based on the above description; how will you test that the expected outputs have been achieved for every menu option? **Be sure this test plan is complete.** Your test plan should minimally test each option in the menu-driven user interface for expected behavior as well as error-handling. Your test plan should be in a spreadsheet format (preferably Excel, CSV, or TSV).
